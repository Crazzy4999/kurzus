I wanted to mention, that this project due to my holiday schedule turned out more like an mvp, but it meets all requirments and even the additional ones.
Also the test data is very small, but just enough to demonstrate all the required functionalities.



Some additional features I was planing, but couldn't implement them in time:

-payment processing
-reorder from history view
-more tests on backend
